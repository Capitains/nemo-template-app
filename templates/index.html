        <p>The Nemo template app is aimed at helping you setting up a Capitains reading environment that contains both
        a User reading interface and an API. Through configuration files, you can change these things. For example,
        You can change this message editing ./templates/index.html</p>
        <p>
            The CTS API is available at <a href="./api/cts">/api/cts</a> and the DTS API will be coming in a short time.
            Updating from this API should be fairly easy !
