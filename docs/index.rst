Introduction
------------

You can do a lot without diving into Python with this application, it's
actually it's first goal. This application will provide you a **way to
generate a website** for TEI/Epidoc texts with a CTS API **without doing
any python**. This "web app generator" is based on `Capitains
Nemo <https://github.com/capitains/flask-capitains-nemo>`__ and
`Capitains Nautilus <https://github.com/capitains/nautilus>`__.

Be warned : this application only works with files following the
`Capitains Guidelines <http://capitains.org/pages/guidelines.html>`__ !

Of course, you can actually go deeper, touch the python, modify some
stuff in Nemo or Nautilus. Nautilus is a full scale app, you can change
some things in it but it's mostly meant as an application that can work
by itself. On the other end, Nemo is meant to be a skeleton for
developers who would like to build their own website ! Here, we made it
a little more configurable so you would not need to do python for most
trivial tasks, but if you want more customization that what you'll see
is already offered, you'll unfortunately have to follow the
documentation of Nemo, do python and learn maybe using the `Nemo
Tutorial <https://github.com/capitains/tutorial-nemo>`__.

The original intent of this repository is to answer to a lack of good
introductory tools and has been built for a workshop in Lyon given by
Thibault Cl√©rice, and as a general effort to make Capitains technically
and timely affordable.

What's the bigget principle behind Nemo and Nautilus ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nemo and Nautilus are built on the idea behind Capitains that texts are
some kind of `Ordered Hierarchy of Content
Objects <http://cds.library.brown.edu/resources/stg/monographs/ohco.html>`__,
to put it simply, your text should be citable by some logical units
which makes up passage. They can be in a hierarchy (with different
levels) such as the traditional poem anthology structure : poem ->
stanza -> line.

Note about the repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current application is in a working state and can be run as a demo.
This application can only be run on Unix machines (Linux and MacOS) :
you'll need to install python3. There is a `French
tutorial <python.fr>`__ and `English
tutorial <python.en>`__. See
`CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/Capitains/nemo-template-app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__ for more advises on how to do the
installations specific to the current repository.
