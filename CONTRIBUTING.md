At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within few days (typically, one business day, but depending on academic times, it could be more). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* If this was discussed before in an [issue](https://github.com/Capitains/nemo-template-app/issues) : it's always better to discuss things, mostly when you found something that was broken
* Write a good commit message : they should state in the first few words the function of the commit, and you can use the remaining lines to give more details.
